## Project Description

In this Mini-project, I will try to create my first software! I am creating a game that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources. This game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output.

## Workflow
* Importing random function in order to pick the random selection from special character
* Defining special character in order to make the password strong
* Getting the input from customer for the name or colour
   * Customer will be able to select whether they want to add their name or their favourite colour in the password
   * If the customer did not defined their name, the program will be ask for customer favourite colour
   * If customer decided not to give their name or favourite colour the programme will acknowledge to customer
* In order to make the password strong we will be adding 5 special character and the end of customer answers (their name or their favourite colour)   
  * Program will be ask customer to define the length of their password
  * The password cannot be less than their customer answer (their name/favourite colour)
* The programme will be check an ensure the length of requested password is more than customers answer (their name/favourite colour)
* The programme will be continue to ask customer to key in the correct password length
  * The program will be randomly select special character (which was define at earlier stage)
  * The program will combine customers answer (their name/favourite colour) with the special character 
* The program will print the preferable secure password for customer at the end.
